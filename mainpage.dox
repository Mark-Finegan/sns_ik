The Inverse Kinematic Labrary (\b IKL) contains tools to invert the differential kinematic of a robot (this version is tested only on fixed base manipulator). 
The methods implemented on the \b IKL are:
- STD 		the standard pseudoinversion of the jacobian
- SCALE 	pseudoinversion with task scaling to satisfy joint constraints 
- SNS		the SNS algorithm which permits to consider hard constraints at joint level

All this methods permits to solve the inversion of the kinematic of a prioritized stack of task. (\em note that only the SNS algorithm guarantees to satisfy all joint constraints).

\section codeapi Code API

\todo the code API section in the mainpage  :-)

<!--
Provide links to specific auto-generated API documentation within your
package that is of particular interest to a reader. Doxygen will
document pretty much every part of your code, so do your best here to
point the reader to the actual API.

If your codebase is fairly large or has different sets of APIs, you
should use the doxygen 'group' tag to keep these APIs together. For
example, the roscpp documentation has 'libros' group.
